# Final Destination
This is a 2D game made in the Unity game engine that I built to develop my skills in 2D game development - It is still a work-in-progress.

I started developing this a few years ago, and have been working on it on and off since - It was only recently uploaded to Github.
The gameplay can be described as a space-based shoot 'em up (shmup).
